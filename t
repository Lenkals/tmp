Dear [Colleague's Name],

Today is a bittersweet day as we celebrate your incredible journey and wish you the very best for the new chapter ahead. It has truly been an honor working alongside you.

Beyond your professional expertise, what stands out the most is the kind, grounded, and generous person that you are. Youâ€™ve always been there to guide, support, and uplift every team member, making our workplace a better and warmer place. Your patience, wisdom, and willingness to help will be deeply missed.

While we will certainly miss seeing you every day, we know that retirement will bring you the relaxation, joy, and adventures you truly deserve. Wishing you endless happiness, good health, and wonderful new experiences in this exciting new phase of life.

You may be retiring from work, but never from our hearts! Stay in touch and enjoy every moment.

With warm regards and best wishes,
[Your Name]
