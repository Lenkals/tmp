Dear Ed,
Today, we say a bittersweet farewell to a truly exceptional colleague and friend. It's hard to imagine our team without you. Your guidance has been a constant source of support, and your mentorship has shaped each of us in profound ways.  While you've always maintained a low profile, your impact on our application and the entire team is immeasurable. Your dedication and work are the foundation upon which we stand. We'll miss your wisdom, your kindness, and your unwavering support.  You've been the silent architect of much of our success, and your impact will be felt for years to come..

Wishing you endless happiness, good health, and wonderful new experiences in this exciting new phase of life.

Little bit of personnel touch: You may be retiring from work, but never from our hearts!(may be too much but that's fine ;)) Stay in touch and enjoy every moment.

With warm regards and best wishes,
Sudheer
